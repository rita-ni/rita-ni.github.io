I just created my own blog on Github today!

I would like to summarize some of the topics discussed in David Laing's lecture this morning about writing a data science blog. The ultimate goal for all forms of communication is "understanding", and among different forms of communication, writing comes with its own disadvantages and advantages. When we are communicating through texts, there is a lack of tone and voice, so sometimes it can be hard to pass on our emotions through writing. Therefore, it is very important to make our writings conversational in order to keep the readers engaged. As the writer, we also don't know who will be our readers so we do not have any clue of their background. Without these information, it can be hard to decide our writing style and how technical we should go with the blogs.

However, writing does not lose in all aspects. I think the biggest advantage of writing a data science blog is that readers can follow their materials at their own pace, and fit their reading times to their own schedule!
